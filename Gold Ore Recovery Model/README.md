# Project Description
Zyfra is a company that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. Created a machine learning model for Zyfra to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore based on gold extraction and purification data. The model was used to optimize the production and eleiminate unprofitable parameters.
* Preprocessed the data to ensure recovery calculations were correct
* Conducted EDA to see the relationship of metal concentrations and the progressive steps of the purification process
* Utilized statistical testing to examine feed size distributions
* Created machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict the gold ore recovery.
