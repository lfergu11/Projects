# Project Description
In this project, I worked with a video games sales dataset. This dataset consists of user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales that are from open sources. The dataset also contains ESRB (Entertainment Sofrware Rating Board) age ratings, which are based on a game's content. I analyzed this data to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This analysis will be used to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns based on these findings.
* Preprocessed the data to prep for analysis
* Conducted feature engineering to prep for analysis
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to identify patterns and trends in the sales data, including analyzing the trends for the different regions
* Conducted statistical testing to see if the user ratings for different platforms or different genres
