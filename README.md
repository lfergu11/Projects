# [Forecasting Churn of Customers (ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/)
* Created machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNeightborsClassifier, and CatBoost Classifier that predicted which customers were at risk of leaving the telecommunications company.
* Used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier.
* By sending the predicted churning customers promotions, assuming a typica rate of conversion this model will reduce churn by 325
