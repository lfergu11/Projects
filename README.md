# Laura Ferguson Data Scientist Portfolio
Welcome to by portfolio! This repository contains some projects that I have exectued. Please feel free to look around and let me know if you have any questions!

# [Rideshare Analysis (SQL & Python)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Rideshare%20Analysis)
* Parsed data from website to obtain Chicago weather in November of 2017.
* Explored the data through queries in SQL, results were saved as .csv to be further explored in Python. 
* Used EDA to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides such as weather.
* Test hypotheses on whether the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare neighborhoods differs on rainy Saturdays.

# [Data Science Jobs Salaries (EDA, SDA & ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries)
Analyzed compensation data for data science related jobs in the US from 2020 to 2023. Used this data to create a machine learning model to predict the salary amount for a data science based role based on job title, company size, and expertise level. 
* Preprocessed data and performed exploratory data analysis
* Performed statistical testing to determine impact of features on salary distributions
* Used encoding & scaling methods to improve trainign of the machine learning models
* Machine learning models created includes Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, LGBMRegressor and CatBoostRegressor
* Utilized GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters to optimize quality of model. 

# [Sweet Lift Taxi Time Series Forecasting (Time Series ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Sweet%20Lift%20Taxi%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting)
* Resampled historical data to change the time interval of the series to fit the model training.
* Applied exploratory data analysis and statistical decomposition to recognize trends and seasonality in the data. 
* Utilized autocorrelation, partial correlation and rolling mean to create lag and mean features for the time series modeling.
* Created machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and LGBMRegressor to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.
* The best model was the Random Forest Regressor using GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters.

# [Forecasting Churn of Customers (ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Forecasting%20Churn%20of%20Customers)
* Created machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNeightborsClassifier, and CatBoost Classifier that predicted which customers were at risk of leaving the telecommunications company.
* Used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier.
* By sending the predicted churning customers promotions, assuming a typica rate of conversion this model will reduce churn by 325

# [Golden Age of Television (EDA)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Golden%20Age%20of%20Television)
* Cleaned and reviewed data to prepare for analysis
* Used Exploratory Data Analysis to learn about the dataset and answered targeted questions.
