# Portfolio - Laura Ferguson
Welcome to by portfolio! This repository contains some projects that I have exectued. Please feel free to look around and let me know if you have any questions!

# [Rideshare Analysis (SQL & Python)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Rideshare%20Analysis)
* Parsed data from website to obtain Chicago weather in November of 2017.
* Explored the data through queries in SQL, results were saved as .csv to be further explored in Python. 
* Used EDA to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides such as weather.
* Test hypotheses on whether the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare neighborhoods differs on rainy Saturdays.

# [Data Science Jobs Salaries (EDA, SDA & ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Salaries)
Analyzed compensation data for data science related jobs in the US from 2020 to 2023. Used this data to create a machine learning model to predict the salary amount for a data science based role based on job title, company size, and expertise level. 
* Preprocessed data and performed exploratory data analysis
* Performed statistical testing to determine impact of features on salary distributions
* Used encoding & scaling methods to improve training of the machine learning models
* Machine learning models created includes Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, LGBMRegressor and CatBoostRegressor
* Utilized GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters to optimize quality of model. 

# [Sweet Lift Taxi Time Series Forecasting (Time Series ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Sweet%20Lift%20Taxi%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting)
* Resampled historical data to change the time interval of the series to fit the model training.
* Applied exploratory data analysis and statistical decomposition to recognize trends and seasonality in the data. 
* Utilized autocorrelation, partial correlation and rolling mean to create lag and mean features for the time series modeling.
* Created machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and LGBMRegressor to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.
* The best model was the Random Forest Regressor using GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters.

# [Forecasting Churn of Customers (ML)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Forecasting%20Churn%20of%20Customers)
* Created machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNeightborsClassifier, and CatBoost Classifier that predicted which customers were at risk of leaving the telecommunications company.
* Used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier.
* By sending the predicted churning customers promotions, assuming a typica rate of conversion this model will reduce churn by 325

# [Video Game Sales (EDA & Statistical Testing)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Video%20Game%20Sales)
In this project, I worked with a video games sales dataset. This dataset consists of user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales that are from open sources. The dataset also contains ESRB (Entertainment Sofrware Rating Board) age ratings, which are based on a game's content. I analyzed this data to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This analysis will be used to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns based on these findings.
* Preprocessed the data to prep for analysis
* Conducted feature engineering to prep for analysis
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to identify patterns and trends in the sales data, including analyzing the trends for the different regions
* Conducted statistical testing to see if the user ratings for different platforms or different genres

# [Megaline Plans Revenue Analysis (EDA & Statistical Testing)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Megaline%20Plans%20Revenue%20Analysis)
Worked as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. 
* Preprocessed data to prep for analysis
* Conducted feature engineering to create for features for analysis
* Aggreagated data to determine total usage and revenue per user
* Performed exploratory data analysis to analyze customer behavior
* Performed hypothesis testing to determine what plan brins in more revenue

# [Instacart Shopper Behavior (EDA)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Instacart%20Shopper%20Behavior)
Conducted Analysis on shoppers from Instacart in 2017. The goal of the analysis was to find which products are most popular, the days and hours of the week that people tend to order, the distribution of the number of orders per customer, and the proportion of reorders for products. 
* Preprocessed the data to prepare for analysis
* Utilized Exploratory Data Analysis to analyze the behavior of instacart shoppers

# [Golden Age of Television (EDA)] (https://github.com/lfergu11/Projects/tree/main/Golden%20Age%20of%20Television)
* Cleaned and reviewed data to prepare for analysis
* Used Exploratory Data Analysis to learn about the dataset and answered targeted questions.
