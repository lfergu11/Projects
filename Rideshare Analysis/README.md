# Project Description
Worked as analyst for Zuber, a ride-share company that's launcing in Chicago. I analyzed historical data on taxi rides in Chicago and historical weather data to find patterns to better understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. I studied a database, analyzed data from competitors and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. 
* Parsed data from website to obtain Chicago weather in November of 2017.
* Explored the data through queries in SQL, results were saved as .csv to be further explored in Python. 
* Used EDA to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides such as weather.
* Test hypotheses on whether the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare neighborhoods differs on rainy Saturdays.
