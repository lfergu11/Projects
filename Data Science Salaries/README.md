# Project Description
Analyzed compensation data for data science related jobs in the US from 2020 to 2023. Used this data to create a machine learning model to predict the salary amount for a data science based role based on job title, company size, and expertise level. 
* Preprocessed data and performed exploratory data analysis
* Performed statistical testing to determine impact of features on salary distributions
* Used encoding & scaling methods to improve training of the machine learning models
* Machine learning models created includes Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, LGBMRegressor and CatBoostRegressor
* Utilized GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters to optimize quality of model.
