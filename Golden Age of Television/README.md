# Project Description
The aim of this project is to work with data from the entertainment industry, focusing on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of *The Sopranos* and is still ongoing. The focus of this project is to investigate how the number of botes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows released during the "Golden Age" of television also have highest numbers of votes.
* Cleaned and reviewed data to prepare for analysis
* Used Exploratory Data Analysis to learn about the dataset and answered targeted questions.
